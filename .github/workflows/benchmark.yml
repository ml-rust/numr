# Benchmark regression check.
#
# Runs on PRs (non-draft) and can be called by other workflows (e.g. release.yml).
#
# How regression detection works:
#   1. baseline.yml saves a baseline JSON after each merge to main (cached by commit SHA).
#   2. This workflow restores that baseline and passes it via --baseline to fluxbench.
#   3. Each benchmark has a per-bench threshold — regressions beyond this are flagged.
#   4. Exit codes are controlled by #[verify] expressions with severity levels:
#        - critical: exits non-zero -> job fails -> PR blocked
#        - warning:  exits zero -> shows warnings in summary
#        - info:     logged in the summary only
#   5. If no baseline exists yet (first run), benchmarks run without comparison.
