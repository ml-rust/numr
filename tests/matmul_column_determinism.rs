//! CPU matmul output must not depend on the size of the thread pool.
//!
//! The tiled CPU matmul splits its output columns across rayon. A column split
//! moves the N-block boundaries the kernel sees, so the chunk boundaries decide
//! which microkernel variant produces an element near a boundary and therefore
//! how its float accumulation rounds. When those boundaries were derived from
//! the thread count, the same model input decoded to different output on a
//! 1-thread run and a many-thread run — a model shipped to unknown hardware
//! cannot behave that way.
//!
//! These tests pin the fix: the chunk boundaries are a pure function of the
//! shape, so every pool size produces bit-identical bytes. A client built with
//! `ParallelismConfig` owns a rayon pool of exactly that size, which is how the
//! shipping API reaches the pool sizes a user's machine would give it.
