// Backend parity coverage for depthwise conv1d (groups == c_in == c_out).
//
// `tests/backend_parity/conv.rs` has no case where groups equals both c_in
// and c_out, and `conv_oc4.rs` only reaches c_out_per_group >= 1 through
// small, non-depthwise group counts. Depthwise conv1d always has
// c_out_per_group = 1, so it stays on the scalar `conv1d` kernel regardless
// of channel count (`CONV1D_OC_BLOCK` in `src/runtime/cuda/kernels/conv.rs`
// is never reached). This file pins that shape ahead of any change targeting
// it, as its own test category alongside `conv_oc4.rs`.
