// Backend parity tests for MatmulOps trait.
//
// `float` holds the dtype-parameterized coverage, now over the whole numeric
// domain. The CPU backend scope stops at 32 bits, so `integer_cuda` holds the
// hand-built CUDA-vs-CPU signed coverage that reaches past it, and
// `integer_gemv_cuda` covers the small-M (decode) shapes of the same kernel.
// `integer_dtypes_cuda` holds the unsigned widths, where the widening into the
// 128-bit accumulator must zero-extend rather than sign-extend.
//
// `i8_cuda` stands apart from both: I8 is the one width whose `matmul` widens
// its output to I32 - in the fused-bias form too, where the bias is I32 as
// well - so its parity tests assert the output dtype as well as the values.
//
// `transposed_b_cuda` covers the F32 tiled kernels that read a `[N, K]`
// weight in place when matmul receives its transposed view, the shape every
// `Linear` produces.
//
// `integer_wgpu` pins the WebGPU I32/U32 kernels at the accumulator boundary:
// their operands stay 32-bit, but WGSL has no 64-bit integer, so the accumulator
// they build out of 32-bit limbs needs coverage the small operands in `float`
// cannot give.
