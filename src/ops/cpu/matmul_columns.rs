//! Splitting a CPU matmul over the N dimension (output columns).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! With the tiered `copy_strided` and the transposed-B packing in place, a
//! profiled VoxCPM2 decode spends 96.5% of its instructions inside the tiled
//! f32 matmul — 45.0% `microkernel_loop_f32::<16>`, 25.8% `tiled_loop_f32::<16>`,
//! 25.7% `microkernel_6x16_f32` — and no measurable time copying. The process
//! still held 124% CPU on a 24-thread machine, because the only parallel axis
//! in [`super::matmul`] is the batch one and the dominant shapes there are
//! single-batch (`[22, 1024] × [1024, 4096]` and friends). One batch, one
//! thread. Splitting the columns is what fills the machine on those shapes.
//!
//! The split lives at the ops layer rather than in the kernel because it needs
//! the client: the pool from `install_parallelism`. Kernels are free functions
//! with no client handle.
//!
//! # The split is environment-free
//!
//! A column split moves the N-block boundaries the tiled kernel sees, so an
//! output element near a boundary can be produced by a different microkernel
//! variant (full 2×NR block, single block, scalar edge) than the unsplit call
//! would use, and its float accumulation lands in a different order. Results
//! move in the last ulp.
//!
//! That is why **nothing about the machine may reach these boundaries**. The
//! first version of this module sized the chunks as `n / thread_count`, and the
//! same VoxCPM2 sentence then decoded to different audio on different pool
//! sizes: at `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` the speech said "dah cuba", at 24 it said
//! "datuh bul" — same model, same seed, same input. Chunk boundaries are now a
//! pure function of the problem shape `(batch_size, m, n, k)`, so a 4-core
//! laptop and a 24-core workstation run the identical arithmetic and only the
//! scheduling differs.
//!
//! The purity has to cover *whether* to split, not just how wide the chunks
//! are: a run that takes the unsplit path is a run with different boundaries.
//! So [`column_chunk_count`] consults neither `rayon::current_num_threads()`
//! nor the client's pool size, and a one-thread pool still walks the same chunk
//! list — rayon simply runs it in sequence. Do not reintroduce a thread count
//! here, in either role.
//!
//! Two further properties are preserved rather than traded:
//!
//! - Accumulation order over `k` is untouched. The `k` blocking in
//!   `tiled_loop_f32` does not depend on `n`, so every chunk sums a given dot
//!   product in exactly the order the unsplit call does.
//! - Every chunk stays on the tiled path. `min_tiled_columns` is the chunk
//!   floor, so a chunk never falls back to the small-matrix kernel — which is
//!   what keeps a transposed B and a materialized B agreeing bit for bit, the
//!   property `matmul_bt_matches_contiguous` gates on.

///
/// Comparing the two unit counts is what replaces the old
/// `batch_size >= threads` test: it picks the wider axis just as well, and it
/// does so without letting the pool size decide which arithmetic runs.
///
/// The chunk width is `max(128, min_tiled_columns(m, k))` — wide enough to pay
