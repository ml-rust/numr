///
/// `DType` provides unambiguous type information so backends can dispatch
/// to the correct reduction unit (e.g., f16 vs bf16 vs i16 are all 2 bytes
/// but require different hardware reduction units).
///
/// # Safety
///
/// All pointer-based methods are `unsafe fn` because passing an invalid `u64`
/// (dangling, wrong device, wrong provenance) causes undefined behavior.
/// Callers MUST ensure:
/// - **NCCL**: pointers are GPU device pointers from the same CUDA context
/// - **MPI**: pointers are valid host pointers
/// - Pointer provenance matches the communicator backend
/// - Buffers remain allocated until `sync()` or `barrier()`
///
/// Higher-level wrappers (boostr's distributed patterns) accept `Tensor<R>`
/// and extract pointers internally, providing a safe public API.
///
/// # Drop contract
///
/// Dropping with pending non-blocking operations attempts best-effort sync
/// with a bounded timeout. On failure the destructor **logs** the error
/// (via `tracing::error!`) and proceeds — it **never panics**.
