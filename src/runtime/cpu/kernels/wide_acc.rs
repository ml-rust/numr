//! Wide accumulators for kernels whose element type cannot hold a running total.
//!
//! A summing kernel that keeps its accumulator in the element type `T` is wrong
//! for every dtype narrower than the total it builds:
//!
//! - A float narrower than F32 (F16, BF16, FP8E4M3, FP8E5M2) stops growing as
//!   soon as the accumulator's spacing exceeds twice the increment, so the sum
//!   converges on a constant or saturates to infinity.
//! - An integer wraps (release) or panics (debug) on overflow, so a total that
//!   crosses the type's range and comes back — a matmul with cancellation, a
//!   mean whose sum overflows but whose average does not — reports a value that
//!   is not merely imprecise but the wrong sign and magnitude.
//!
//! The fix is the same in both cases: accumulate in a wider type and narrow
//! exactly once at write-out. [`WideAcc`] gives the two accumulators those
//! kernels need, so `cumsum`, `matmul`, and the integer reduction epilogues
//! share one definition of "wider" instead of open-coding three.
//!
//! Pick the accumulator with [`WideAcc`]'s two implementors:
//!
//! - `f32` for `DType::is_narrow_float()`. F32 is the accumulator format the
//!   rest of numr already uses for these dtypes (see `reduce_kernel` and
//!   `reduce_epilogue`), and it holds every F16/BF16/FP8 total that the output
//!   dtype can represent.
//! - `i128` for `DType::is_int()`. It is exact for any product or sum of two
//!   64-bit integers, so no integer dtype loses information on the way in.
//!
//! Output dtypes never change: [`WideAcc::to_elem`] narrows back to `T`.
//!
//! # Saturating, not wrapping
//!
//! Integer narrowing clamps to the output dtype's range, and the i128
//! accumulator itself uses saturating add and multiply. This is a deliberate
//! choice, not an accident of the types:
//!
//! - It matches [`Element::from_f64`], which already saturates because Rust's
//!   float-to-int `as` cast saturates. Widening the accumulator therefore does
//!   not introduce a second narrowing convention.
//! - It is the only option that stays a total function. Wrapping reports a
//!   value with the wrong sign, and returning an error would make an overflow
//!   anywhere in a batch fail the whole call.
//!
//! `i64` and `u64` have no wider integer dtype in numr, so their *output* still
//! cannot represent a total that overflows them; saturation is what they get,
//! and the i128 accumulator at least keeps intermediate partial sums exact.
//!
//! # Which side of the line a kernel is on
//!
//! - ACCUMULATORS saturate: `cumsum`, `cumprod`, `matmul`, `mean`, and the
//!   integer reductions. They build a running total wider than one element, so
//!   clamping the total is the only answer that keeps the sign right.
//! - ELEMENTWISE ops wrap: `add`, `sub`, and `mul` on two tensors. Each output
//!   is one machine operation on two elements, and wrapping is what every
//!   array library and every GPU ISA gives there.
//!
//! A new kernel picks the accumulator side only when it carries state across
//! elements.
