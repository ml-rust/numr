//! CPU runtime implementation
//!
//! The CPU runtime uses standard heap allocation and provides a reference
//! implementation for all tensor operations.
//!
//! # Broadcasting
//!
//! NumPy-style broadcasting is fully supported for binary arithmetic operations
//! (add, sub, mul, div, pow, max, min). Shapes are broadcast according to standard
//! rules: dimensions are right-aligned and expanded where one operand has size 1.
//!
//! Comparison operations (eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge) also support broadcasting.
//!
//! # Non-contiguous Tensors
//!
//! Operations handle non-contiguous tensors via strided memory access. For
//! broadcasting, a strided kernel is used that correctly handles stride-0
//! dimensions (where a single value is broadcast across the dimension).
