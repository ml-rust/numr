// WMMA (Tensor-Core) GEMM kernel body, shared by every F16/BF16 tensor-core
// kernel in matmul_wmma.cu. The instantiations live there; this header holds
// the tile geometry, the epilogue transforms, and the kernel body macro.
//
//
// 16x16x16 tensor-core tiles with F32 accumulation. F16 uses nvcuda::wmma
// fragments; BF16 uses raw ldmatrix + mma.sync, because wmma's BF16 path never
// emits ldmatrix. Both backends live in matmul_wmma_mma.cuh and are selected
// by the body macro's MMA argument.
// Shared-memory staging of A and B tiles means the wmma fragment pointers are
// always shared-memory addresses, so global addresses never need to satisfy
// the fragment-alignment requirement. The staging loads themselves are 128-bit
// where the operand allows it, and fall back to element-at-a-time otherwise;
// see WMMA_VEC_OK below for why that fallback is a correctness path.
//
// Warp tiling. The warp grid is fixed at WARP_ROWS x WARP_COLS = 4x4 warps
// (16 warps, 512 threads); the block tile is a parameter of the kernel body
// macro, carried as the per-warp fragment counts WM x WN:
//   warp_row = warp_id / WARP_COLS  (0..3)
//   warp_col = warp_id % WARP_COLS  (0..3)
//   Each warp computes WM x WN fragments of 16x16 outputs.
//   BLOCK_TILE_M = WARP_ROWS * WM * 16
//   BLOCK_TILE_N = WARP_COLS * WN * 16
// Two tiles are instantiated in matmul_wmma.cu:
//   WM=2, WN=2 -> 128x128 block tile, 4 mma_syncs per warp per K-step
//   WM=1, WN=1 ->   64x64 block tile, 1 mma_sync  per warp per K-step
// The tile is part of every kernel symbol name (matmul_wmma_f16_128x128,
// matmul_wmma_f16_64x64, ...), the same convention matmul_f32_tiled.cu uses.
// The host picks one per launch; see
// src/runtime/cuda/kernels/loader/matmul_wmma.rs.
//
// Epilogue: per-warp float scratch in shared memory.
//   Both compute backends need float* for their F32 accumulator; we cannot
//   store an F32 fragment directly into an F16/BF16 global buffer.
//   Each warp stores its F32 fragment into a dedicated 16x16 float scratch
//   region, then each lane converts + writes elements to global C via STORE_FN
//   (float->HALF_T). No cross-warp collisions. One fragment is in flight per
//   warp at a time, so the scratch is 16 warps x 16x16 floats = 16 384 bytes
//   for every tile shape, independent of WM and WN.
//
// Static smem (WMMA_STAGES-stage ring, aliased with the epilogue scratch).
// WMMA_STAGES is 2 today (classic ping-pong); the ring shape is what would
// let a later multi-stage pipeline raise it without reshaping this staging
// code. BLOCK_K is a PER-TILE value passed into WMMA_TILE_CONSTANTS (below),
// not one file-scope constant, so the staging footprint varies by tile as
// well as by build target. Per stage the staging holds
//   smem_A: BLOCK_TILE_M x SMEM_STRIDE_A halves
//   smem_B: BLOCK_K      x SMEM_STRIDE_B halves
// and the total is max(WMMA_STAGES stages, scratch), because the scratch is
// written only after the K-loop ends and therefore overlays the staging
// buffers:
//   BLOCK_K=16 (SMEM_STRIDE_A=24): 128x128 -> 20 992 B, 64x64 -> 16 384 B
//   BLOCK_K=32 (SMEM_STRIDE_A=40): 128x128 -> 37 888 B, 64x64 -> 19 456 B
//   BLOCK_K=64 (SMEM_STRIDE_A=72), 64x64 only, sm_80+: -> 36 864 B
// The 64x64 tile never needs more smem than the 128x128 tile at its own
// BLOCK_K, so it never lowers the resident-block count below what 128x128
// gets. The static_assert in WMMA_KERNEL_BODY_EPI turns any future
// combination that breaks this into a compile error, not a launch failure.
//
// Staging (bounds-checked zero-pad loops, vectorised where legal):
//   Threads cooperatively copy the tile with strided loops. The fast path
//   moves eight halves (128 bits) per access, so the loop trip count and the
//   address arithmetic and branching that go with it drop by 8x; this is where
//   nearly all of the kernel's non-mma instructions used to go. It is taken
//   only when the global operand is 16-byte aligned with a row stride that is
//   a multiple of eight halves, and the tile does not overhang the contraction
//   (A) or N (B) edge. Everything else takes the element-at-a-time path.
//   Out-of-bounds positions are zero-padded identically on both paths, so the
//   two agree bit-for-bit. Both are deterministic and correct for all shapes.
//
// Any M, N, K >= 1 is a valid launch: the staging loops zero-pad past every
// edge, including K, and the epilogue masks its store per element. A row
// stride that is not a multiple of WMMA_VEC_HALVES stages that operand one
// element at a time. The host (loader/matmul_wmma_policy.rs, `use_wmma`)
// pads N and K up to a multiple only when the GEMM is heavy enough that the
// copy pass costs less than the scalar staging. M is launched as it is.
//
// Double-buffering is synchronous: the global loads for K-tile k+1 are issued
// before the mma work for tile k, so their latency overlaps the compute. One
// __syncthreads() per K-tile.
//
// cp.async double-buffering is DISABLED (documented nondeterminism dead-end).
// Do NOT enable it. The synchronous path is deterministic and correct.
