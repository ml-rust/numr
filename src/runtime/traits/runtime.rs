//! Core trait for compute backends

/// Core trait for compute backends
///
/// `Runtime` abstracts over different compute devices (CPU, GPU, etc.).
/// It uses static dispatch via generics for zero-cost abstraction.
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - `Device`: Identifies a specific compute unit (e.g., GPU 0, GPU 1)
/// - `Client`: Handles operation dispatch and synchronization
/// - `Allocator`: Memory management with optional freeze support
/// - `Graph`: Captured computation sequence for replay (CUDA Graphs, etc.)
/// - `RawHandle`: Escape hatch for custom kernel launching
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let device = CpuRuntime::default_device();
/// let ptr = CpuRuntime::allocate(1024, &device)?;
/// // ... use memory ...
/// CpuRuntime::deallocate(ptr, 1024, &device);
/// ```

    /// [`CapturedGraph`][crate::runtime::CapturedGraph], which bundles the
    /// compiled graph with `Arc` clones of the caller-supplied `inputs` and
    /// `outputs` tensors. The bundled tensors prevent their device memory from
    /// being freed while the graph is alive.
    ///
    /// # Contract
    ///
    /// - `outputs` must be allocated **before** calling this method (outside
    ///   the closure). The graph encodes their device addresses at capture
    ///   time; they must not move.
    /// - The closure `f` must write results into the output tensors in-place.
    ///   It must not allocate new output buffers (those would be subject to
    ///   `AUTO_FREE_ON_LAUNCH` and freed after the first replay).
    /// - `inputs` and `outputs` are passed as shared slices; the method clones
    ///   each tensor (cheap `Arc` bump) to hold in the `CapturedGraph`.
